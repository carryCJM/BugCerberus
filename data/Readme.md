## Generating Additional Data

Users can generate additional training data using the scripts provided in the `Static Analysis` folder. These scripts support extracting code contexts at **file-level**, **function-level**, and **statement-level**, which can be used to create custom training datasets for bug localization and repair tasks.

For more details about the project and training process, please refer to the top-level [README.md](../README.md) file.
